# Team Portfolio Generator

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>The objective of this project is to create an application that will help business and development teams generate a portfolio
of their employee rosters displaying their basic information such as name, id, email, and another attribute specific to their job title.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>
I created a parent element called "Employee" which I then extended to the child elements "Engineer", "Intern", and "Manager".

I then ran tests using the "npm run test" command in the integrated terminal to make sure that they were all working harmoniously together and were true extensions of the Employee element.

I then created the parameters I would include in the command line questionaire that would help us create our squads portfolio, within the index.js file.

The I worked to create an html boilerplate which would properly implement the information passed through the command line questionnaire and generate the data in an organized and viewable manner.

I then ran "node index.js", answered the prompts, and was able to generate a web page that included all of my teams data in a neat and organzied manner, also implementing a css bootstrap link to make it look cleaner, and organize the inputted data.</p>
